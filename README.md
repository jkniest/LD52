Join Randolf Randi, the vegetable-loving hero, as he fights to protect his beloved garden from a never-ending horde of plant-napping foes. Arm your wall with a variety of funky weapons and use your skills to outwit and defeat the bosses that threaten your garden every 2 minutes. With each vegetable you collect, you'll earn XP to power up your defenses and become the ultimate Plant Protector. Will you be able to keep your plants safe, or will your enemies steal the show?
